# Phase-3-Active-Record-Code-Challenge
For this assignment, we'll be working with an e-commerce domain. We'll be focusing on the product reviews.

We have three models: User, Review, and Product.

For our purposes, a Product has many Users, a User has many Productss, and a Review belongs to a User and to a Product.

Product - User is a many to many relationship.

##Note
You should draw your domain on paper or on a whiteboard before you start coding. Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data.
